# peer production participation

## What I have done
I start contributing to [the Government Zero(g0v)](https://g0v.tw/en-US/) community, mostly are paperwork for now.
After finishing the first paper and the interview I have done in the second paper. I finally figured out what are the primary platforms and tools that people in the g0v community mainly use. The first one is GitHub, of course. The second is Slack, as their chatting tool. The third one is an open, collaborating markdown  editor platform called the HackMD.
In the beginning, I browsed what people are working on and tried to learn how to use these tools by myself. This is motivated because I can easily catch up on projects that people are working on. Then I found their code of conduct and asked one of the project leaders if their projects are welcome to be edited or giving feedback. Mostly I only check on othersâ€™ documents and find if there is anything that I can contribute to.

### How it was contributed
There are three things that I think I had contributed ,and I am contributing.
First of all, while browsing those documents, I left comments if there is anything wrong. For example, there was a broken link in one of the instruction files. I left a comment that the link was not working and provided the working link asking if that was the page the owner wanted. This feels like the issue function in GitHub.
Secondly, if there is a document that just started, after getting the permit from the project owner, I start adding contents. In this case, they are also working on instructions about 'open source spirit.' I assumed that these people understood what the 'open source way' is, but they wanted to have a file as a portal to those existing guides on the internet. There was only a link that links to [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/). I started aggregating other Chinese materials about open source from other open communities in Taiwan.
Thirdly, I am also working on a document that is organizing the papers or articles about open-source on the internet, information about open-source conferences and activities. 


### How the work was reviewed
In my opinion, some of the works are not actually being reviewed. I did not ask someone to check on my works. However, I can see what I had done was remained after someone else edited the documents.

## Compare to the expectations described in the first paper

I think that the g0v is focusing on the government ,and I was expecting to do something about government data. However, what I had done was more related to the community than the government.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I felt very motivated because of two reasons. One is I did have learned something, especially the markdown tool, HackMD. Another reason is that I can really join the community that I have admired for years.

Before this class and participation, I could not really understand what GitHub is and how it works. This is the main obstacle for me to join this developer-based community. Now I have overcome not only the GitHub but also the markdown in this semester.
