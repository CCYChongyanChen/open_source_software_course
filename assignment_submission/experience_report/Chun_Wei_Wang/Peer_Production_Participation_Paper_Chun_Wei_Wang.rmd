                                        Peer Production Participation Paper                 Chun-Wei Wang
                                                                                                     
    When I decided to participate in G0V, a Taiwanese open-source community,  the project Cofacts drew my intention, and I know immediately that this is the project I would like to contribute. Cofacts, a project found by a group of engineers, designers, and editors, is a program that helps people against internet hoaxes. With the development of the internet, hoax, scam, hate speech, and fake news are spread faster and more widely, especially in Taiwan. Although people can still identify the correctness of certain news by studying further information and looking for evidence, only a few people are willing to spend time to identify whether the information they heard is true. Also, due to the generational difference in Taiwan, many elders didn't accept higher education, which makes it hard for them to distinguish facts from hoaxes. As a result, the project Cofacts dedicate to use open-source and crowd-sourcing methods to fight with internet hoaxes.
    
    In Cofacts, there are three different main groups: 1.Engineers, programing for the chatbot in the popular communication app LINE in Taiwan. 2.Designers, designing for the information architecture and user interface of the Cofacts editor platform and the chatbot. 3.Editors, working on the editor platform to investigate the potential hoax information reported by Cofacts users. I decided to participate as one of the editors in this project since it is the group that needs more people. According to the statistical data, there are 250 new messages entering Cofacts for verification; however, only less than 12 active editors who can respond to those messages every week. The editor is also the most accessible role for people to participate in this project since all it requires is your time to investigate reported messages. During my 2-month participation, I responded to 4 reported news, and each of them took me about 2 hours to search for reliable evidence and to write proper responses for them.

    As a new editor, I found that Cofacts make good use of the open-source method to new editors get started. In the hack folders for editors, there is a clear governance statement, detailed step-by-step tutorial, verification criteria, and case studies. By viewing all these information, people can quickly learn how to start verifying messages. Also, most of the time, when someone found problems writing responses to certain news, they can always refer to the information in the hack folder to find suggestions.
    
    Although it seems that Cofacts being very supportive to the contributors, there are still some problems that I faced during my participation. First of all, the interface for editors is not easy to look for specific messages. There was a message about the candidate of the president that I wanted to write a response. But I didn't have time to investigate for evidence at that time. When I finally got time to research for that message several days after, it took me more than half an hour to find the original message.
    
   Moreover, although Cofacts is an open-source project, I didn't get any feedback from any other contributors during these two months. Since the works of editors are rarely overlapped, if there are no problems with your responses, you won't hear from other contributors in this project. Since massive messages are coming into the platform every day, your responses might not even be viewed by any contributors. The lack of feedback from others in the project kinds of reduces my motivation to participate in the project. 
   
    Fortunately, one of my responses was rated helpful by 19 users, which is good feedback for me. The reported news was about how the government deprived the scholarship for native students to support international students to live in Taiwan. By reviewing the whole regulations and analyzing the published data from our ministry of foreign affairs, I wrote the response to identify the news as biased with incorrect information and slant. And after one week, the response received over ten helpful ratings and reached nineteen on November 26th. Through the positive rating from the users, I finally feel that my responses are valuable and can help others identify the correctness of the information on the internet.
    
    The participation of Cofacts is a good experience for me. Not only because I can apply what I learned from this course to get to know the project as well as the G0v community well but also that I got the chance to make contributions for things that help others. I think I'll keep participating in the Cofacts project and seek opportunities to make more contributions to it.
