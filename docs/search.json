    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to the materials for a course on open source software development, taught at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin. The course is taught by James Howison, with contributions from a set of wonderful TAs, including Chongyan Chen.\nThe course was developed as an undergraduate version of a course on Peer Production: Open Source, Wikipedia, and Beyond.\nI call this a “socio-technical course” because I interleave social theory about open source (such as theories of motivation, approaches to governance, sources of lack of diversity) in among the technical skills needed to participate in open source projects (git and github commands, markdown, unit testing, packaging). This interleaving is inspired equally by Karl Fogel’s approach in Producing Open Source Software, and the intellectual traditions of Sociotechnical Systems, Sociomateriality, and the Consortium for the Science of Sociotechnical Systems (CSST).\nIn these materials I present these in two separate sequences: “insights” and “skills”. When I teach, though, I interleave them in what I hope are synergistic ways. For example, when teaching about coordination theory, the week includes the git and github approaches to managing dependencies (such as identifying and resolving conflicts, as well as branching). I pair literature on knowledge sharing up with skills to do it, such as understanding Markdown and referring to Issues/Commits. You can see this interleaving in the most recent syllabus at Section 2.1.\nThe course begins with a two-part physical in-class exercise: students fold paper planes, and share improvements. The first exercise addresses how patents and copyright affect sharing, building on each others work, and the division of claims. The second takes a more technical tack, and addresses management of versions and conflicts. These exercises give a physical analog for the topics in the course, giving a grounding for discussing intellectual concepts and git commands."

    "text": "3 Objectives and Assignments\nThis course explores “open source software development” which is a name for the open collaborations that produce open source software. Open source software is a thing that is built by people, an artifact. But the way that it is developed, the way that people work together to build it is of great interest. “The open source way” is of practical interest for everyone building software, because open source development has lead the creation of ways of working used throughout software work. For social and organizational scholars, “the open source way” is of inte3rest in advancing our theories of how people can work together and how technology matters.\nThe “open source way” is also known as “peer production” and that way of working extends beyond open source, to places like Wikipedia. Perhaps not coincidentally the Wikipedia page on Peer Production is quite useful:\nAs we learn about open source and peer production we’ll learn to distinguish it from different kinds of online collaborations, such as crowdsourcing, citizen science, question and answer sites, and mere sharing of code. Near synonyms for the way of working taught in this course are: “The open source way”, “Open collaboration”, “Open mass production”.\nThis is a course is about a sociotechnical phenomenon and it takes a sociotechnical approach. In practice this means that we’ll be learning both conceptual insight and practical skills. The course weaves together learning how to use key technologies of collaboration (e.g., git, github, travisCI, markdown) at the same time that we learn social and organizational theory about peer production (e.g., the role of copyright licenses, motivations of participants, governance models, coordination theory, models of collaboration risk, cultures of collaboration).\nThere are no prereqs for this course. While we will be discussing software development students will not be required to program. We will use the command line as we learn to use git and github everything will be covered in class. I try to build a set of analogies for git and github, going beyond teaching the commands to give ways to think about git.\nStudents will need access to a computer for classes, any version of Windows, Mac, or Linux will do. Students facing difficulties with their IT should contact the iSchool help desk (via help@ischool.utexas.edu) who can refer on to other resources as available."

Students should email the professor prior to class if they cannot make it. Material throughout the course builds on earlier material (both technical and conceptual). If you cannot make class you should refer to the online materials first and then consult with your classmates. Office hours are not for personal replays of teaching, nor can they compensate for not participating in discussion.\nHints on participation:\n\nUseful participation can come from asking questions if you don’t understand the point someone is making. If you have questions, very likely others do to.\nYou can also summarize discussion which helps everyone by giving them something to test their understanding of the discussion.\nYou can challenge or disagree with people, sometimes that can be introducing a counter-example or questioning whether evidence really means what the speaker originally thought.\nI really welcome examples from your own experience. For example if there is an organization, movement, or line of thought (modern/traditional) in your culture that relates to open source development, I would love that to be part of the discussion.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Technical Challenges\nThe course will have assignments based on the technical topics we are learning, including use of the DataCamp course (see below).\n\n\n3.2.3 Open Source comparison paper\nFor this assignment students will write a 1,000 word scholarly essay describing and analyzing efforts to adapt the “open source way” outside of software development. Students will be given a list of five projects they need to research and analyze to compare to “the open source way”. Examples could include open hardware, open governance, open culture. The paper should draw on the conceptual literature to compare and contrast the challenge faced by these adaptation efforts to what we’ve learned about “the open source way”. The paper will also describe the collaboration infrastructure used and compare it to the technologies we have learned in class).\nThe paper will be authored in Plain Text or Markdown and submitted via a pull request to the class github. Include your name in the filename and at the top of the document, and include a note at the top of the file telling me which formal citation approach you are using (e.g., APA, MLA, etc). Students are cautioned that as a scholarly paper proper citation and use of sources is required otherwise students will face academic misconduct proceedings. See “Academic Integrity” presentation if at all unsure.\n\n\n3.2.4 Open Source Trace Data analysis Project\nStudents will be introduced to datasets of archives of activity in open source projects and develop their own analysis. For example, students might want to highlight those participants that are most active over time in a project, show whether leadership has changed within projects, or analyze license usage over time.\nThere are three graded components, each to be submitted via a pull request. All components should reference the insight readings that we do throughout the course.\n\nIdentifying and describing a project. ~500 words. Authored in plain text or markdown (ensure file is encoded with Unicode UTF-8 encoding and Unix/LF-only line endings). This paper should clearly identify the intended analysis and argue for its relevance, including using literature to identify expectations. Include your name in the filename and at the top of the document, and include a note at the top of the file telling me which formal citation approach you are using (e.g., APA, MLA, etc).\nImplementing the analysis and report. ~500-1000 words, authored in RMarkdown, using the citation features. Students should describe the dataset, their analysis (possibly including graphs), and their interpretation. Students should compare their experience with their expectations described in the first paper and use at least two references from our conceptual literature to justify their inquiry. Create a folder in assignment_submission/trace_data_project/your_name and all files in that folder. Submit via a pull request from a branch created just for this submission (i.e., not master), and post that URL to the Canvas assignment, ensure this is a separate PR from your slide submission (below).\nCreating and giving a presentation on their participation. Presentations are limited to 5 minutes, this should be approx 4-6 slides long and be authored using Markdown that produces slides. Presentations will occur in our final class meeting. Submit via a pull request from a branch created just for this submission (ie not master), and post that URL to the Canvas assignment."

You read about farmers who purchase John Deere farm equipment. Many want to be able to work on their equipment on their own, right on the farm. This is both because they are at a great distance from dealers, the equipment is expensive to transport, and they have paid a lot for the equipment and object to paying more to keep it working.\nIn many ways this is the same situation that Richard Stallman (found of the Free Software Foundation) faced when dealing with the printer in his office. This is one of the foundational stories of the free software movement.\nHave you faced issues in trying to repair something? What prevented you?\nDiscussion: what is needed to repair a blender? A car? A list sorting algorithm? A web-page?\nWhat role does source code play? What else is needed?\n\n\n3.3.2 To avoid “proprietary lock in”\nThe popularity of open source can be understand as a kind of software escrow. Producers of tools want their users to rely on the tool, but if the code is hidden then a user is taking on a significant risk. That is is that the software stops getting updated because the company disappears. This means that maintenance stops, which means that the code suffers “bit rot” or “code collapse”.\n“Code collapse” occurs when software is not maintained. Not only do new features not appear, but security holes can be discovered which cannot be fixed. More subtly the code gets out of sync with its ecosystem, so that the way it talks to other software might stop working as other software is updated. If something changes in the software requirements (e.g., a change in the tax code) then the software cannot be updated.\nSo the buyer of proprietary software want an assurance that the software will continue to be updated, but no firm can assure its customers that it will be around for ever. To solve this purchasers used an approach called “Software Escrow”. Escrow means using a 3rd party (not the firm buying the software and not the firm building the software) to keep a copy of the software delivered. That escrow agent keeps that code secret unless specific events occurs, such as the software producer going out of business or discontinuing the product. In those cases the firm buying the code gets the source (and a license to use it). Escrow is a sort of insurance policy to help make relying on other people less risky.\nOpen source shares some of these characteristics. When building on someone else’s code, knowing it is open source means that the user can be sure they can taken over maintenance, even if the original developers stop working on the project.\n\n\n3.3.3 Shared maintenance of infrastructure\nWhen organizations compete with each other they want you to purchase their product, and not the product of their competitor. To purchase “Extra” brand chewing gum, and not “Trident” brand.\nYet much of the effort that goes into producing a product is spent on things that are not directly related to the product they are selling. Think of things like the supply of office furniture, the repainting of lines in the parking lot. These sort of efforts are known as “infrastructure”.\nIn many cases infrastructure is purchased from other companies, known as “contracting” or “out-sourcing”. The general logic is that companies that specialize in office furniture will do a better and cheaper job than if the chewing gum company was to make (or even buy) its own furniture. For example, Economics of scale mean that the outsourced furniture company can get bulk purchase discounts and pass them on to customers. They can also have full time people focused on monitoring safety issues with furniture and be responsible for fixing or replacing chairs that might injure people, saving the chewing gum company from lawsuits for dangerous chairs.\nMany users of open source are using open source software in the same way. For example IBM had a product called “WebSphere” which they sold to firms to run their “intranet” (internal corporate network publishing information or managing business processes). IBM originally wrote and maintained their own web server (as well as the application software that ran on top of it). Eventually, though, they changed to using the open source web server called Apache httpd. They argued that this saved them a lot of time maintaining their own infrastructure internally.\nIBM even started contributing changes that it needed or were helpful to their product back to httpd. They could have kept those changes secret, but then they would just have more infrastructure to maintain. Instead, they reasoned, they would contribute those changes back to httpd, effectively giving that work to their competitors (and everyone), but in return they received a lot more eyeballs on that code, ensuring that it was better tested and kept in sync.\nThey shared the cost of maintenance on the infrastructure to concentrate effort on their “secret sauce” of the WebSphere application layer, which was the thing that customers were really buying from them.\n\n\n3.3.4 The smartest people don’t work for you\nEach firm competes to hire great people. Yet it is unreasonable to think that you will have all the best people in the world working at your organization. For this reason firms seek to access outside intelligence. Sometimes this is possible through outsourcing, but other times problems are quite specific and require engagement with information or requirements that are quite specific to the business.\nBill Joy (from Sun Microsystems)is credited with the saying,\n\n“no matter who you are, most of the smartest people work for someone else,\n\nFirms therefore wna to access those smart people. Various approachs help, including “Crowdsourcing,” “innovation contests,” and “thought leadership” (publishing white papers and blogs that are discussed in public and then watching the discussion).\nOpen source projects are another place where expert outsiders can be found and engaged on topics of importance to firms."

    "text": "3.4 Why is open source interesting?\nOpen source is interesting to a wide group of thinkers, both academics and thinkers in business and software.\n\nOpen source is successful. Almost all software has a foundation of open source, and open source tools successfully compete with proprietary software.\nThat success is unexpected. Why “give it away”, why “work for free”?\nOpen source (and Free Software) are politically engaged, holding the belief that they can changed the world through openness and freedom. Those building openly find this an emancipatory experience that they want to share with others (see Dunbar-Hestor’s “Hacking Diversity” book)\nOpen source is the leading edge of distributed work. Open source is done online, with participants that often don’t know each other and are all around the world. All the issues of remote work were encountered first in open source, which has developed interesting approaches to these problems."

    "title": "4  Motivations",
    "section": "4.1 How to ask questions people want to answer",
    "text": "4.1 How to ask questions people want to answer\nMuch of this material is based on How To Ask Questions The Smart Way, Eric Raymond and Rick Moen with the addition of academic references and frameworks.\nOpen source projects are famous for having direct access to very knowledgeable people about the source code. Unlike when you purchase software, you can very likely get questions in front of some of the people that wrote the underlying code.\nBut ask yourself why they are there, reading and answering user questions. What drives them, what motivates them?\n\n4.1.1 RTFM\nThere is always a risk that a poorly asked question will be met with this response:\n\n\n\nRTFM Mug by Gubatron (CC-licensed http://www.flickr.com/photos/gubatron/3102412751)\n\n\nRTFM means to “Read the F***ing Manual” (which I’ll read as Read the Fine Manual). This rather unfriendly, and indeed unwelcoming response can occur when a question is asked in a way that doesn’t understand what it is that motivates people to participate in online support forums for software.\n\nI note that open communities are not necessarily welcoming places. In fact they can be quite aggressive, even toxic. It is perhaps not unrelated that open communities are also no diverse. We will discuss this later in the course when we consider Bias and Lack of Diversity in @bias-and-lack-of-diversity\n\nLakhani and von Hippel (2003) studied the Apache httpd mailing list. They mailed a survey link to participants the first time they saw them post to the list, only mailing each person once. They received responses from 28.9% of info providers, and 16.6% info seekers.\nThey report that :\n\nspending time in the forum had excellent ROI (return on investment) for information seekers (Seekers saved 9 minutes for every 1 minute spent writing questions).\nProviders answer questions that are easy for them, rarely do they seek out additional information to help answer.\nInformation Providers invest a lot of time in the forum, average of 80 hours a year.\nKey motivations to answer were reciprocity and reputation within Apache (not career prospects)\nBut information providers are primarily there to learn (>90% of time spent reading, not answering).\n\nSo, very knowledgeable people answer people’s questions when it is easy for them to do so (not spending time preparing and researching, this is not Q&A for $$$ like Quora). So what is it that brings them to these forums (thus making it quick and easy for them to answer): learning.\nHuh? What do already knowledgeable people learn by hanging out watching less knowledgeable people ask questions?\nExercise\n\nWhat does someone learn from reading questions (and answers) in a technical forum?\nWhat does someone learn from answering?\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Engaging intellectual curiosity\n\nExperts love interesting problems and the solving of them.\nInteresting problems are those that reveal some new insights\nUninteresting problems are either obvious or unsolvable (poorly specified or not actionable).\nAsk questions like an intellectual partner.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Steps to answered question\nAgain, this is derived from How To Ask Questions The Smart Way, Eric Raymond and Rick Moen\n\nChoose the right venue\nDo (and show) your homework\nConvey your situation\nAsk an actionable question\nEngage the interest of your audience\nFollow up showing that you tried their suggestions. Don’t be the “Ok, fixed it now” guy\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/979:_Wisdom_of_the_Ancients\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Examples\n\n4.1.4.1 J Random Hacker\nDirectly from (http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#examples)[http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#examples]\n\nStupid: I’m having problems with my motherboard. Can anybody help?\n\n\nJ. Random Hacker’s response to this is likely to be “Right. Do you need burping and diapering, too?” followed by a punch of the delete key.\n\n\nSmart: I tried X, Y, and Z on the S2464 motherboard. When that didn’t work, I tried A, B, and C. Note the curious symptom when I tried C. Obviously the florbish is grommicking, but the results aren’t what one might expect. What are the usual causes of grommicking on Athlon MP motherboards? Anybody got ideas for more tests I can run to pin down the problem?\n\n\nThis person, on the other hand, seems worthy of an answer. He/she has exhibited problem-solving intelligence rather than passively waiting for an answer to drop from on high.\n\n\nIn the last question, notice the subtle but important difference between demanding “Give me an answer” and “Please help me figure out what additional diagnostics I can run to achieve enlightenment.”\n\n\n\n4.1.4.2 Getting it wrong (and yet so wrong)\nThe second example is one from my person experience.\n\n\n\nAn email sent to the R Bugs Website, I included a large file with dump from sample command to help with debugging\n\n\nI received two different responses:\n\n\n\nA vaguely chilling RTFM style response\n\n\nSo, what happened? Well, the second response made it much more clear.\n\n\n\nA friendlier response: this was not a bug!\n\n\nSo … I had done some things right, but I had made a mistake. Sending to the r-bugs mailing list implied that I thought there was a bug. But there wasn’t, it wasn’t a problem with R, it was a problem with my computer setup. I should have sent this to another forum first, one for general support, instead I had implied that there was a bug in R. Insulting people’s work is a risky way to try to get their help!"

They have established the “Open Source Definition” with 10 elements (slightly abridged below):\n\n** Introduction **\n\n\nOpen source doesn’t just mean access to the source code. The distribution terms of open-source software must comply with the following criteria:\n\n\n\nFree Redistribution\n\n\n\nThe license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the software … The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.\n\n\n\nSource Code\n\n\n\n\nThe program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form … Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor or translator are not allowed.\n\n\n\n\nDerived Works\n\n\n\nThe license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\n\n\n\nIntegrity of The Author’s Source Code\n\n\n\nThe license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified form only if the license allows the distribution of “patch files” with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code. The license may require derived works to carry a different name or version number from the original software.\n\n\n\nNo Discrimination Against Persons or Groups\n\n\n\nThe license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.\n\n\n\nNo Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor\n\n\n\nThe license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.\n\n\n\nDistribution of License\n\n\n\nThe rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.\n\n\n\nLicense Must Not Be Specific to a Product\n\n\n\nThe rights attached to the program must not depend on the program’s being part of a particular software distribution…\n\n\n\nLicense Must Not Restrict Other Software\n\n\n\nThe license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.\n\n\n\nLicense Must Be Technology-Neutral\n\n\n\nNo provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Copyleft\n\nSome licenses add an additional restriction; They are called copyleft licenses (a play on the word copyright).\nItem number 3, Derived Works, says:\n\n\nThe license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\n\nCopyleft licenses alter this by changing “must allow” to “if distributed, must require”\n\nThe license must allow modifications and derived works, and if distributed must require them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the original software.\n\n\nCopyleft means derived works, that are distributed, cannot be licensed under a different license but must be licensed under the same license. See detailed discussion at copyleft.org\nThis is informally referred to as viral: derived works are “infected” and must all be copyleft.\nThis only applies if the changes are distributed. Usually this means distributed beyond the individual or company that owns the copyright. This means that companies can alter copyleft software, as long as they don’t let that code outside their own organization.\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Recent controversies discussion\n\n5.2.5.1 Cloud software\nThe original open source licenses were written before cloud, and the idea of Software As A Service (SAAS). Why does cloud and SAAS change a key circumstance?\n\nCloud delivery of software\n\nWhy was the Affero GPL created?\nAmazon Web Services and open source.\n\nElastic Search has created their own license. What does it do differently? Is it an open source license? Would OSI consider it to be an open source license?\n\n\n\n5.2.5.2 Artificial Intellegence software\nNeural Networks express much of their logic not in code, but in the weights of a trained neutral network.\n\nWhy does this change impact open source?\nCan trained neutral networks be modified or improved? What would be needed?\nWhat does the OpenRAILs license try to do? See Hugging Face reading above (Section 5.1).\nWould OSI judge that license to be “open source”? Which provisions, if any, might it violate?\n\n\n\n5.2.5.3 Recent license violation articles.\nhttps://undeleted.ronsor.com/voice.ai-gpl-violations-with-a-side-of-drm/\nDiscussed on Hacker News here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34681636\nNot just violating GPL, but likely other licenses too (not including license in distributed non-copyleft open source).\nLots of these out there, found this as searching:\nhttps://hackaday.com/2022/07/15/watch-out-for-lasercutter-manufacturers-violating-gpl/\nIncluding stories about startups whose cash out was sunk by OSS license violations:\nhttps://abovethelaw.com/2022/01/how-to-ensure-open-source-risks-wont-scuttle-your-deal/\nPoint is not to scare people from using open source, but to understand the very real meaning of the licenses. The more sophisticated understanding of open source you are gaining from this course will be an advantage in the job market."

    "section": "8.2 Why rewind?",
    "text": "8.2 Why rewind?\nWhen we are working we often want to try things out before we are 100% sure that they will work. We want to be able to experiment and find our way through a problem. If our experiment doesn’t work, we want to be able to step backwards in time, to find an earlier version that is a good new starting point.\nIn many ways this is identical to the idea of a “save point” in a game. We can step backwards in time and try again. We can reload that point at any time in the future. In our paper plane analogy, we can reach out and grab any tray in our repository.\nGit enables us to save full copies of our working directory. We can then get back to the state of our work at any time we made a commit. When we check out a historical state, we get the files and the folders as as they were. So git actually swaps out the directory.\nWhen I first started using git, I found this a bit confusing. usually when one restores from a backup, it is more like downloading a file. One gets to choose: - what to call the newly obtained older version - where to put it - what to do if there is a file that would be over-written.\nWhat git does, though, is it swaps out all the files and folders with the previous version.\nAs we’ve seen, though, git is more fine-grained than a video game save-point. We often have files that have changed that we don’t want included in our save-point, this is why we have the git add stage before git commit.\nThus we can have untracked files or folders hanging around in our working folder. Git won’t change these when we do a checkout. So what happens is:\n\ngit checks that all tracked files are in a “clean” state. This means that they are unchanged from the last commit. This is git checking that you have “saved your work” before it swaps out the files.\ngit goes to its repository, locates the commit you ask for, and swaps all the tracked files and folders in the working directory.\ngit remembers what commit you’ve moved to, so that if you make edits you can decide how they should be applied into the stream of commits in your repository.\n\nTo move backwards in time we use the git checkout command. We have to let git know which commit we want to go back to. We can specify that using the name that git uses, which is the hash (e.g., 1b2162e) shown by git log.\nStarting with our 3 commit test-rewind repo:\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* 50590c5 (HEAD -> main) made third edit\n* 39f89db made second edit\n* 1b2162e made first edit\nWe can move to the first commit using\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git checkout 1b2162e\nwhich produces the output\nNote: switching to '1b2162e'.\n\nYou are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\nstate without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.\n\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\ndo so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:\n\n  git switch -c <new-branch-name>\n\nOr undo this operation with:\n\n  git switch -\n\nTurn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false\n\nHEAD is now at 1b2162e made first edit\nIf we run our viz command we can see a little more:\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* 50590c5 (main) made third edit\n* 39f89db made second edit\n* 1b2162e (HEAD) made first edit\nSee how the word HEAD now appears on the bottom line and not the top line? This is git’s way of telling us what is checked out.\nWhen git says detached HEAD (a little intense sounding) git is highlight for us that our current working directory is not at the last commit. This means that if we try to make a new commit git wants us to know that it won’t just pop onto the top of the repo like usual. (git will create an unnamed branch, we’ll discuss branches later).\nFor now, though, we can inspect files back at this version, and we can shift to another version (using checkout). For example we can move back to our top commit, using git checkout main (where main might be master on a system configured with an older git).\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git checkout main\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* 50590c5 (HEAD -> main) made third edit\n* 39f89db made second edit\n* 1b2162e made first edit\nNotice how HEAD now points to the top commit? If we edit/add/commit our commits will drop back on top.\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git add README \njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git commit -m \"Made fourth edit\"\n[main ff7997b] Made fourth edit\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\njlh5498@INFO-A64206 test-rewind % git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color\n* ff7997b (HEAD -> main) Made fourth edit\n* 50590c5 made third edit\n* 39f89db made second edit\n* 1b2162e made first edit\nRemember, git swaps out all the tracked files when you do a checkout. If you have untracked files you will find they are unaffected by a git checkout. Create a file called my-untracked-file run git status then run git checkout <earlier-commit> (where <earlier-commit> is a hash for your first commit), then run git status again."

Each day the point of sale system makes new data available. Each night your computer executes a script (report_script.Rmd) to access the data, create, and email the report.\nWe are going to manage a situation where we want to: 1. experiment and break things 2. keep things running\nIt is very hard to do these things at the same time. Branching helps us to do this.\nOne option might be to maintain different versions of files using different file names (report_script.Rmd and new_report_script.Rmd. This becomes very messy when we have many files and folders involved (/images and /new_images???). This is even worse when we have multiple experiments and attempts going on in parallel and entirely hopeless when we move online and are working with groups of people.\nRecall, though, that git enables us to “swap out” our working directory. Until now we’ve kept this linear, each new version added after the last. But branching enables us to keep parallel lines of commits (as though we had two lines of trays with on our paper plane repository table)."

But you don’t know if you can get that done before the report has to run, and you don’t want to get caught fiddling with master because if the report tries to run you could end up with nothing going out that night.\nSo you first merge master over to your towards_chart branch, and ensure that things work well and the two pieces of work done in parallel work well together (charts and dealing with the new column).\nFirst confirm which branch you are in, this command lists the branches and the one highlighted with the * is the current branch. git status can also show you.\ngit branch -v \ngit branch -v\n  master          576bc90 A fix to match new data format\n* towards_chart bef7b72 Finished up the charts\nThen merge over the master branch into the towards_chart branch.\ngit merge master\nAuto-merging reporting_script.Rmd\nCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in reporting_script.Rmd\nAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.\nAh, good thing we did this on the branch because we do end up with a conflict. Git can resolve some conflicts but not all. Git shows conflicts by adding special lines of text into the file (using >>>>>> and <<<<< as indicators. To resolve them we remove those lines and leve the file the way we want it to be.\n# Initial code for table report\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n# Work towards charts\n# More work towards charts\n# Code to finalize the charts\n=======\n# Fix to match new data format\n>>>>>>> master\nThe parts separated by ======== show edits that conflict. Looking at this we can see that we want all the lines, so we edit the file to show:\n# Initial code for table report\n# Fix to match new data format\n# Work towards charts\n# More work towards charts\n# Code to finalize the charts\nNow we can save that file. Git knows that we are fixing a conflict, so git status shows:\nOn branch towards_chart\nYou have unmerged paths.\n  (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\")\n  (use \"git merge --abort\" to abort the merge)\n\nUnmerged paths:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to mark resolution)\n    both modified:   reporting_script.Rmd\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\nAnd now we can add and commit to finish the merge.\ngit add reporting_script.Rmd\ngit commit -m \"merged bug fix with charts code\"\n[towards_chart e420a05] merged bug fix with charts code\n(Git can only flag syntactical conflicts, not semantic conflicts, so one would also try running some test reports to make sure things are all working).\nSo once you’ve resolved all issues, then you can merge the towards_chart branch back to master, signalling that you are ready to launch your new report with charts.\ngit checkout master\ngit merge towards_chart\nSwitched to branch 'master'\nUpdating 576bc90..e420a05\nFast-forward\n reporting_script.Rmd | 3 +++\n 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)\nFinally we can visualize this branching, editing, and merging in two ways. First we can use this handy command to see a visualization in the command line.\ngit log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color               \nWhich will show us this (using an image here because the color doesn’t copy):\n\nWe can also see this visually using learngitbranching, see the short video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.1 Exercises (in-class):\n\nGo to “Learn Git Branching” site: https://learngitbranching.js.org/. (Note that this site is multi-locale, see the small planet icon in the bottom right?)\nDo exercises 2 and 3 (“Branching in Git” and “Merging in Git”)\nShift back to Rstudio on the server and replicate the “Merging in Git” lesson. You will need to start with these commands (to create a new, empty, repo):\n\ncd ~\nmkdir replicate_learngitbranching\ncd replicate_learngitbranching\ngit init\nRemember that when we are working in the terminal it is different from learngitbranching because we have to actually create, edit, and save files before we can commit. We also have to use git commit -m 'some message' rather than just git commit."

Note that the pull request will not say “Able to automatically merge” (but go ahead and create the PR anyway.)\nWith everyone looking at Maintainer’s computer, Maintainer should refresh the github page for the shared repository and will see two pull-requests in the pull-request tab.\n\nThe maintainer should accept each PR, but will need to resolve any conflicts that emerge. For small edits like this, we can edit the file on the github website. The maintainer can choose whatever contributions they want (the original line, the line from ContributorA, or the line from ContributorB; or both. When we resolve conflicts however the file is after removing the <<<<< ======== and >>>>>> lines will be what is in the shared repository.\n\nEach person should then synchronize. For Maintainer that just means git pull (since they have a direct clone of upstream). For Contributor B and Contributor A they have to first get the changes in upstream, then push them to their fork.\n\n\n$ git pull upstream master\n$ git push"

These are distinct from your github account (remember git can be used independently of an online service or with online services other than github).\nIf you are seeing messages that end like this:\nYou can suppress this message by setting them explicitly. Run the\nfollowing command and follow the instructions in your editor to edit\nyour configuration file:\n\n    git config --global --edit\n\nAfter doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:\n\n    git commit --amend --reset-author\nThen you can run these commands to set a username and email. Note that these can be anything, they aren’t a login or checked against anything, they are just metadata attached to your commits. Nonetheless having them make sense for your identity makes sense when sharing code publically. They can easily be a made up identifier (pseudonym/handle/accountname).\ngit config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n\n\nA.1.2 git commit throws me into a weird mode\nIf you type git commit just on its own rather than git commit -m \"Some message\" you will see something like this:\n\n# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n#\n# On branch master\n# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.\ngit needs a commit message. When you don’t provide one it throws you into a text editor, expecting you to type a small novel.\nThe editor that you go into by default is the vi or vim editor. It can be confusing because it has multiple modes (ie typing doesn’t always just produce text).\nThe best option is to:\n\nHit esc twice\nType :q!\nRedo your commit using `git commit -m “Some message”\n\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-vim\nThe option below does not work in Rstudio because Rstudio captures the Ctrl key commands\nYou can also configure git to use another editor: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2596805/how-do-i-make-git-use-the-editor-of-my-choice-for-editing-commit-messages\nFor example, the nano editor is easier to use. You can set that run running\ngit config --global core.editor \"nano\"\nIn nano we can type a commit message as usual. The bottom of the screen shows commands. Nano uses the ^ symbol to represent the Ctrl key. We have to save the file and then exit Nano. So to save the message and return to the commandline we use:\nCtrl + O\nThen:\nCtrl + X"

We can’t delete our home folder, because it has everything else inside it. We have to somehow tell the computer that the home folder should not be a git repo. Happily, then only thing that makes it a git repo is that it has a .git folder inside it. You can confirm by running:\nls -lah\nThe -a flag to ls makes it show all files and folders, even the hidden ones that start with a dot.\nTo fix this we could just delete the .git folder but we might lose data that way (if we had already added work to that repo). So safest thing is to make a new folder inside our home folder, and then move the .git there.\nmkdir backup_home_git\nmv ./.git ./backup_home_git\nNow you could cd backup_home_git and use that folder as a git repo. But probably you are about to clone from github (in which case a new folder will be created) or you are about to use git init to create a new local repo (in which case you should create a folder first, cd into it, then run git init."
