### git commit throws me into a weird mode

If you type `git commit` just on its own rather than `git commit -m "Some message"` you will see something like this:

```bash

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch master
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
```

git needs a commit message. When you don't provide one it throws you into a text editor, expecting you to type a small novel.

The editor that you go into by default is the `vi` or `vim` editor.  It can be confusing because it has multiple modes (ie typing doesn't always just produce text).

The best option is to:

1. Hit `esc` twice
2. Type `:q!`
3. Redo your commit using `git commit -m "Some message"

You can also configure git to use another editor: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2596805/how-do-i-make-git-use-the-editor-of-my-choice-for-editing-commit-messages>
