# Github collaboration {#sec-github-collaboration}

Exercises done in groups of three. 

Incidentally [George Simmel](http://socio.ch/sim/work.htm) in early 20th century says that everything changes when you go from 1 to 2 people (a dyad), and then again going from 2 to 3 (a triad). He said that because at 3 people it's the first time you can be outvoted :) Check it out.

## Collaboration picture

![](images/Git-MovingStuffAround.png)

In the image above we can see the overall situation when people are collaborating through a git hosting service like github.

At the top we see the "Github Cloud" and at the bottom we see our laptop.  Everything we have done so far (`edit-save-add-commit` and `branching`) happens on the laptop.

In the Cloud we see two repositories.  The one on the right called "Upstream" (or sometimes "Project" or "Shared") is the space where all our work will collect.  The one on the left called "Origin" is our cloud copy of the shared repository.  You can think of a fork as a backup space for the repo on your laptop; the fork lives in your github account namespace.

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant upstream AS upstream<br />aka shared/project
    participant origin AS origin<br />aka fork
    participant laptop AS laptop<br /> aka local
    
    upstream ->>origin : github fork
    origin ->>laptop : git clone

    
    laptop ->>laptop : git branch
    laptop ->>laptop : edit/add/commit
    
    upstream ->>upstream : maintainer commits<br />or pull requests<br />from others merged

    laptop ->>laptop : edit/add/commit
    
    note over laptop : Work finished, need to<br />gather changes since clone
    
    upstream ->>laptop : git pull upstream 
    laptop ->>laptop : resolve conflicts<br />git add/commit
    laptop ->>origin : git push
    origin ->>upstream : github pull request
```

There are 6 steps to this workflow (also depicted in diagram below)

1. We create a fork of the upstream repo. This happens on github.

2. Bring that fork down to our laptop where we can work on it.  This is done using `git clone` a command that is run on the laptop.  We pass `git clone` the URL of the fork.

3. Use `git branch` and `git checkout` to create a branch, then the `edit-save-add-commit` as usual.  

4. Synchronize using `git pull upstream` to get any work that has happened in upstream since you cloned your fork. Such work might come from the maintainers of the project doing their own work there, or the maintainers merging in pull requests from other contributors. This is quite similar to merging `main` to our branches if working locally.

5. Use `git push` to move your new edits up to github.  Note that they go to your fork, not directly to upstream.

6. Create a `pull request` on github.  We do this while looking at our fork. This lets the upstream repo know that you have work ready to contribute. 

The pull request can then be merged by the maintainer of the upstream repo. 

> A PR is a request for the maintainer of the upstream repo to run a `git pull` from your branch on your fork into their repository 

## Basic forking workflow setup

1.  Group of three: *Contributor A*, *Maintainer*, *Contributor B*.

**Arrange your chairs so that you can see each others screens. That means sitting in a row so you can easily see what each other are seeing. Maintainer sits in the middle.** 

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  ContributorA---|left of|Maintainer---|right of|ContributorB
```

2.  *Maintainer* creates new repository on github.

3.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* log into github, find the new repository created by *Maintainer* and fork it.

![Image showing fork button in top right](images/fork_button.png)

4. *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* should clone their fork repo to their working space. 

Usually this is a laptop, but this semester we are using [Eduhub Rstudio](http://edupod.cns.utexas.edu/), which you can access as usual via that link.  

Log into Rstudio, and work in the Terminal tab. Before running git clone, everyone needs to ensure they are in a folder that is not inside another repo. You can place repos anywhere you want. I suggest placing them all into your home folder on edupod. You can be sure you are there by running this command (read as "cd tilde" because tilde is a shortcut for your home directory).

```sh
cd ~
```

To be sure that you aren't inside another repo you can run `git status` and you *want* to see a fatal error.

``` sh
git status
fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /stor/home)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
```

If you do not see the fatal error, then you need to move up in your folder hierarchy until you are not in a repo. Use `cd ..` or `cd ~`. If you still get that error and you are in your home folder, see FAQ for "I accidentally made my home folder a git repo" at @sec-faq-home-git-folder 

The contributors will have their own github username in the fork URL. You can quickly copy that with this button on github.

![Image showing button that copies the URL](images/clone_repo.png)

Then clone your repository and change directory into it.

::: spoiler
``` sh
git clone <fork_repo_url>
cd <repository_name>
```
:::

5.  Establish remotes. *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* will specify the shared repository as "upstream".

::: spoiler
``` sh
git remote add upstream <maintainers_repo_url>
```
:::

If setup properly then the `git remote -v` command will show four lines for *Contributor A* and *Contributor B*:

``` sh
git remote -v
origin  <fork_repo_url> (fetch)
origin  <fork_repo_url> (push)
upstream <maintainers_repo_url> (fetch)
upstream <maintainers_repo_url> (push)
```

::: {.callout-note}
Note that git automatically creates the `origin` remote as whatever URL was used with `git clone`. :::

Each exercise below assumes this setup as the starting point.

## Sharing work and synchronizing

*Requires three part repository setup as shown above in [Basic forking workflow setup](#basic_forking_workflow_setup)*

The contributors are each going to do some work, then pass it up through their forks to the upstream shared repository. This will use `git push` and Github pull requests (which the *Maintainer* will see and approve). We will then use `git pull upstream` so that each contributor gets the work that the other has done.

1. *Contributor A*, *Contributor B* should create a new branch and switch to it (replace YOUR_ROLE_NAME with either contributorA or contributorB):

::: spoiler
```sh
git checkout -b YOUR_ROLE_NAME-new-branch
```
:::

1.  *Contributor A*, *Contributor B* each create a file named after their role (ie contributorA.txt, contributorB.txt). You can use the Rstudio editor on edupod to create and save the file, or you can create a file with some simple content using:

```sh
echo "A line of content" >> YOUR_ROLE_NAME.txt
```

(replace YOUR_ROLE_NAME with maintainerA or maintainerB)

2.  Add and commit your new file.

::: spoiler
``` sh
git add YOUR_ROLE_NAME
git commit -m "Contributing a file"
```
:::

3.  Push your new file. By default git push uses `origin` as the destination (so this new branch and file will go to your fork)

::: spoiler
``` sh
git push
```
:::

::: {.callout-note}
If you have trouble with GitHub authentication, remember that it is the email address associated with the GitHub account and the password has to be a PAT. That is the special password you copied from the GitHub site.  See @sec-github-solo for details.
:::


You may also see a message about having an upstream branch. Something like this:

```bash
git push
fatal: The current branch test-branch has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin test-branch
```

You can re-run the command as given (copy from in Terminal).

The incoming contributions from *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* these files are now at their fork, and will need a Pull Request to move to the shared repo.

4.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* go to github and look at their own fork (if you've forgotten the URL you can use `git remote -v` and look next to `origin`. Github knows that the fork now has material that the shared repo doesn't, and will make a New Pull Request button available.

![Image of drop down menu for branches, shows for-pull-request and main](images/selecting_branch_on_github.png)

![Create PR screen](images/create_pr_screen.png)

Since we created files with unique file names, these PRs will show up as "Able to be automatically merged".

5.  The *Maintainer* should now refresh their page (so they are looking at upstream) and they will see a number next to the Pull Request tab:

![Image showing new Pull Requests available](images/new_pr_available.png)

The *Maintainer* can accept both pull requests, which will merge files into the main branch on the shared repo.

::: spoiler
![Image of accepting PR](images/merge_pr.png)
:::

Now the contributors need to synchronize with the shared repo. They first have to switch to the main branch, then they can use `git pull` to bring the new files from the other contributor into their local repo. 

6.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* should swith to main, then pull upstream.

::: spoiler
``` sh
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```
:::

7.  Finally, *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* will push these new changes from the shared repo up to their forks.

::: spoiler
``` sh
git push
```
:::

I've always thought it is a little strange that a contributor's fork doesn't distribute changes from upstream, but that new work from the shared repo gets to the fork via the contributor's local repo on their laptop. After all, github knows the fork is connected to the shared repo ... but this is the roundabout way it works.

## Once more, but with maintainer editing as well.

In the exercise above you may have noticed that the maintainer was not editing and contributing files, only ContributorA and ContributorB were.

The maintainer is the owner of the shared repository (which we call "upstream"). For this reason they can work directly in that repository, and they don't need to make their own fork. The maintainer can directly use `git clone` on the shared repository.

::: {.callout-note}
For the maintainer upstream and origin are the same; The Maintainer only has one remote set up.
:::

The maintainer can still create pull requests (and they should do). This places them on an equal footing with other contributors, so everyone else can follow the work and comment on it. Maintainers can make a pull request from a branch in their repository to another branch (usually main/main).

This gives us another insight: a Github pull request is from a branch to another branch; it doesn't matter if those branches are in forked repos or in the same repo.

1. *Maintainer* should clone the shared repo

```sh
git clone MAINTAINER_URL
```

If the maintainer then runs:

```sh
git remote -v
```

they will see:

```
origin  MAINTAINER_URL (fetch)
origin  MAINTAINER_URL (push)
```

So ... for the maintainer (the owner of the shared repo) the shared repo on their clone is called `origin`, but those the maintainers (who are working through a fork) it is called `upstream`. This can be a little confusing. Remember that when we run `git clone` git automatically sets up a remote called `origin`.

2. *Maintainer* creates a branch and changes to it:

```sh
git checkout -b new-maintainer-branch
```

3. *Maintainer* creates and saves a file called 'maintainer.txt'

You can do this with the same command that the Contributors used:

```sh
echo "Content for the file" >> maintainer.txt
```

4. *Maintainer* pushes up to the shared repo.  Remember: GitHub email/PAT token as password. See @sec-github-solo If you see a message about `--set-upstream` you will also have to copy that the command in the error message to set up the branch on the remote repo.

```sh
git push
```

Since the maintainer is working on a new branch, this creates a new branch on the shared repo on github.

5. *Maintainer* views the new branch on github, creating a pull request.

This pull request is a request (to themselves) to bring the code from the new-maintainer-branch branch to main.

6. *ContributorA* and *ContributorB* should find the new PR (on the shared repo) and make comments (e.g., "Hey, looks good").

7. The *Maintainer* should merge the branch and close the PR.

8. Everyone should update their own local repo (on Rstudio). First, everyone needs to switch to main (because that is where the PRs are merged to).

```sh
git checkout main
```
Then obtaining the changes, differs slightly between roles: 

* Contributors (who are working through a fork) will need to get the changes from upstream so they need to pull from upstream main, then push to their forks

```sh
git pull upstream main
git push
```

* The maintainer (who cloned the shared repo) will just need `git pull`. They don't need to push because the changes are already in the repo they cloned from.

```sh
git pull
```

## Generate merge conflict

(If starting here, confirm that your Group of three has the setup in [Basic forking workflow setup](#basic_forking_workflow_setup) as the starting point.)

The point of this exercise is to intentionally create conflicts in editing, to demonstrate how they show up in Pull Requests.

1. *Maintainer* should change to the main branch on their local repo (on EduPod Rstudio)

```sh
git checkout main
```

2. *Maintainer* should then create, add, commit, and push a file called `animals.txt` with this content:

```
lion
tiger
leopard
turtle
```

3.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* should synchronize to receive this file.

::: spoiler
``` sh
git pull upstream main
```
:::

4.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* should both create and switch to a branch.

```sh
git checkout -b animal-branch-CONTRIBUTOR_NAME
```

5, *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* should each edit the animals.txt file by adding their name to the first line in the `animals.txt` (so it reads `lion contributorA` or `lion contributorB`). They add, commit, push to their forks. 

::: {.callout-note}
Note that these edits are incompatible, so they will generate a conflict when we try to merge them below.

They are incompatible because git can't automatically merge them. Git works line by line and is quite smart (able to notice the insertion of lines, for example) but some merging of work needs human attention.
:::

5.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* should then go to github and look at their animal-branch on their forks. They should create a pull request by hitting the 'New Pull Request' button. Note that the pull request's may **not** say "Able to automatically merge" (but go ahead and create the PR anyway.)

6.  With everyone looking at *Maintainer*'s computer, *Maintainer* should refresh the github page for the shared repository and will see two pull-requests in the pull-request tab. 

The maintainer should merge contributorA's branch. This should merge cleanly since contributorA directly edited the `lion` line that the maintainer wrote. 

However, the second pull request will create a merge conflict. So the maintainer will have to resolve the conflict.

### Resolving merge conflict

For small edits like this, we can edit the file on the github website. 

The maintainer can choose whatever contributions they want:
- the original line
- the line from ContributorA
- the line from ContributorB
- Both lines
- Any other decision they make

To show a conflict, git inserts special lines into the file, using these characters: `<<<<<` `========` and `>>>>>>` While those are present, git will not let us continue.

::: {.callout-note}
This way of showing a comparison between files is called a `diff`.  You can read more about diffs. [e.g., A tutorial on diff and diff format](http://www.math.utah.edu/docs/info/diff_3.html)
:::

To resolve the conflict we have to remove those lines.  As long as they are gone, git will accept whatever is in the file as the new desired state.  Git is only working at the syntax level, it does not check the semantics of the file (e.g., whether the code runs, or whether the resulting document is readable or logically consistent.)

The maintainer should see the file marked with a conflict like:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
lion contributorA
=======
lion contributorB
>>>>>>> animal-branch-contributorB
tiger
leopard
turtle
```

We can read this as follows:

> The code in HEAD has "contributorA" next to lion.  But the code in animal-branch-contributorB has conflicting code for that line, showing "contributorB" next to line.

The maintainer should go ahead and remove the `<<<<<` `========` and `>>>>>>` lines, then save the file.

To let git know we are done resolving a conflict we need to then `git add` and `git commit` that file.  If we are editing on GitHub that is done automatically for us.

6.  Each person should then synchronize their local repos. 

For the *Maintainer* that just means `git pull` (since they have a direct clone of upstream). 

For *Contributor B* and *Contributor A* they have to first get the changes in upstream, then push them to their fork.

::: spoiler
``` sh
git pull upstream main
git push
```
:::

## Deleting branches

We have been using branches as temporary working areas, intended to be used, merged, and then deleted.  Later we will discuss longer lived branches (such as a `staging` or `dev` branch).

For short lived branches, though, we usually want to delete them when they are merged.  GitHub offers that as an option after a PR is accepted.

We can also delete a branch on our local repo, then push that change up to GitHub.

```sh
git branch -d localBranchName
git push
```

Or we can do this with a single command:

```sh
git push origin --delete remoteBranchName
```

The maintainers should go ahead and delete their branches, push to GitHub and make sure that they are gone from the fork.  Note that we don't need to delete the contributor's branches from `upstream` because they never went there (the PR asked to bring the changes on the branches directly into the `main` branch on the shared repo).

## Exercises

1. Rotate your group, repeating the animals conflict exercise.  When you change maintainer you will need to repeat the repository set up (use entirely new repos on GitHub). Use edits to different lines in the animals file.  

2. Experiment to find out what happens when a contributor adds additional commits to a branch on their fork, after they have opened a PR.

2. Experiment to find out what happens if contributors don't synchronize their local repo after having their PR accepted.

<!-- # Split a pull request -->

<!-- Here the scenario is that you've created a pull request but it hasn't yet been accepted. -->

<!-- If you add additional commits to that branch then they will get added to the pull request. Remember, a pull request says, "Please come to this repo and get everything on this branch." So it's not the same as puting some commits in a zip file and mailing them, it's more like puting things into a particular spot (like a mailbox or dead-drop in a spy movie), and telling people to pick them up from there. -->

<!-- So you can always add additional things before the person comes to pick them up. This is useful because if there is a conversation around the pull request then you can easily update things. For example, if someone said "Please fix a typo or pull from upstream before we consider your pull request," you'd be able to do so without opening another PR (just add, commit, push to your branch on your fork and the PR is updated). -->

<!-- However, it is an issue if you *accidentally* add new commits to a branch before a pull request is accepted. Now your pull request has two sets of commits: the first set you meant to include and the second set you didn't. This mistake is particularly easy to make if you are developing on the `main` branch in your fork (which you shouldn't do), but also happens if you are have more than one contribution that you are working on, as when you are doing something else while waiting for a PR to be accepted. If you've accidentally added too many files to your pull request---something that is easy to do if you use `git add *` or some variant---you'll also find yourself needing to remove content from your PR. -->

<!-- First, take a look at this in the Learning Git Visualizer, I have created a level called [Split Pull Request](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?gist_level_id=f7b4b63960ed80fa9a76728d853f2546). -->

<!-- ## Split before submit -->

<!-- Things would be better if you had created a new branch for the first set of commits, then a second branch for your second set of commits, never adding either set to your main branch and following the "always work on a (short-lived) feature branch" rule. Then each set of commits would be "sent" through a different pull request. -->

<!--             / Branch for first set. -->
<!--            / -->
<!--     main - -->
<!--             \ -->
<!--              \ Branch for second set -->

<!-- The grey sections below are commands, the white is output. -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- This is a git command that you should copy -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     This is output. -->

<!-- Below, I make a new repo, create a README file and make a commit, and edit it once making another commit: -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git init -->

<!--     Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/howison/Documents/UTexas/Courses/PeerProduction/practice/.git/ -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- touch README -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git commit -m "Adding readme" -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     * d5eb1e8 (HEAD -> main) Adding readme -->

<!-- So now we have a single commit on a single branch `main`. To create a new file we can use `touch` (which creates an empty file here, but that's ok). -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- touch main2 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git add main2 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git commit -m "add main2" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     [main 749454e] add main2 -->
<!--      1 file changed, 2 insertions(+) -->

<!--     * 749454e (HEAD -> main) add main2 -->
<!--     * d5eb1e8 Adding readme -->

<!-- Now we have added a commit on `main` so the `HEAD -> main` shows the 'tip' of the main branch. -->

<!-- Now we can create the feature branch (`first_set_branch`) for the first set and look at the commits we've made. Using `git checkout` with `-b` creates a new branch: -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git checkout -b first_set_branch -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     Switched to a new branch 'first_set_branch' -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- touch first_set_file -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git add first_set_file -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git commit -m "first set edit" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     [first_set_branch d71ade9] first set edit -->
<!--      1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) -->
<!--      create mode 100644 first_set_file -->

<!--     * d71ade9 (HEAD -> first_set_branch) first set edit -->
<!--     * 749454e (main) add main2 -->
<!--     * d5eb1e8 Adding readme -->

<!-- Now we can see that we have two branches `(main)` and `first_set_branch`. `HEAD` shows us that we are currently in the `first_set_branch` branch. -->

<!-- Now we're going to change back to main. -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git checkout main -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     Switched to branch 'main' -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     * d71ade9 (first_set_branch) first set edit -->
<!--     * 749454e (HEAD -> main) add main2 -->
<!--     * d5eb1e8 Adding readme -->

<!-- See how the `HEAD` changed, showing us that we're looking at the main branch. Notice also that there is a commit (`d71ade9`) that isn't in `main`. -->

<!-- Now we can create the second branch: -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git checkout -b second_set_branch -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     Switched to a new branch 'second_set_branch' -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- touch second_set_file -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git add second_set_file -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git commit -m "first edit in second set" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     [second_set_branch 9dc0a23] first edit in second set -->
<!--      1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) -->
<!--      create mode 100644 second_set_file -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     * 9dc0a23 (HEAD -> second_set_branch) first edit in second set -->
<!--     | * d71ade9 (first_set_branch) first set edit -->
<!--     |/   -->
<!--     * 749454e (main) add main2 -->
<!--     * d5eb1e8 Adding readme -->

<!-- Now the visualization has changed a bit. We can see that there are two branches that "come off" head after `749454e`. We can work independently, and could create pull requests for each branch separately. We are still on the second set's branch, let's add a second file to it: -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- touch second_set_file2 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git add second_set_file2 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git commit -m "added to second set" -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     [second_set_branch 04d6967] added to second set -->
<!--      1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) -->
<!--      create mode 100644 second_set_file2 -->

<!-- Now the branching in this in-terminal visualization is a bit clearer. -->

<!-- Ok, so this is the right way to do it: with each file/commit on the correct branch (and thus separate PRs). -->

<!-- ## Recover via splitting a PR -->

<!-- Pretend we had never made the two additional branches but made those commits all on the main branch. Then if a pull request opened after the first set of files `51f2622` was never accepted, our second set would have just piled on top and been added to the pull request. -->

<!--     * 51f2622 first set edit -->
<!--     * f945961 add main2 -->
<!--     * 367e25a Adding readme -->

<!-- The problem here is that the top two commits (reading downward) are on `main` and should be on `second_set_branch` and the third and fourth commits are on `main` and should be on `first_set_branch`. -->

<!-- So our challenge is to make this linear setup look like our branched setup above. There are a few routes we can take. -->

<!-- First we're going to use the ability to create a new branch from an earlier point in history. By default `git checkout -b newbranch` will branch from the current HEAD, but we can tell it to branch earlier. So first we're going to create our two branches as though we'd done it before we started working, which is when HEAD was at `f945961`. -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git checkout -b first_set_branch f945961 -->

<!--     * f945961 (HEAD -> first_set_branch) add main2 -->
<!--     * 367e25a Adding readme -->

<!-- So now we can see `(HEAD -> first_set_branch)` at `f945961` as the branching point for first_set_branch. However the commits we need on that branch are not on it, we need to bring them over from `main`. -->

<!-- We can do that using `git cherry-pick` pointing to each of the two commits we want to bring over. Below we can see (moving up the left) that we have a `first_set_branch` which has both of our needed commits. Note that this doesn't \``move'' them from the`main\` branch, but creates new commits with the same content. -->

<!--     Switched to branch 'first_set_branch' -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- ls -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     README          first_set_file  first_set_file2 -->

<!-- So now if we create pull requests from each of those branches, they'll contain just the content we wanted in each of them. Hurray! -->

<!-- ### Exercise: -->

<!-- Groups of 3. Nominate *Maintainer*, *Contributor A*, and *Contributor B*. -->

<!-- 1.  *Maintainer* creates a repo on Github. -->
<!-- 2.  *Maintainer* adds 2 commits and pushes. -->
<!-- 3.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* fork and clone (and add upstream). -->
<!-- 4.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* create a feature branch called \`will_need_split. -->
<!-- 5.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* add four commits of four files on `will_need_split` -->
<!-- 6.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* create a pull request to `upstream` from their `will_need_split` branch (including all four commits). -->
<!-- 7.  *Maintainer* rejects the pull request, closing it and commenting "please split this up" (and direct which files go together, probably 2 in each.) -->
<!-- 8.  *Contributor A* and *Contributor B* follow procedure above to end up with two new branches `split_branch_1` and `split_branch_2` send through separate pull requests with only the right commits/files in them. -->
<!-- 9.  *Maintainer* eventually accepts each of the four split up pull requests. -->

<!-- ### Dealing with remaining commits -->

<!-- Now we just have to consider what to do about the additional commits on `main`. This is going to depend on a few things. Do you have additional commits on `main` that you haven't distributed among new branches? Do you want `main` to exactly reflect the history of `main` on `upstream`? How tolerant are you of "messy history"? It's also going to depend on whether `main` had been pushed up and whether others might have built on top of it. -->

<!-- There are many options, here are two: -->

<!-- 1.  Revert the commits that you "moved" to the branches. `git revert` creates "opposite" commits, that undo any changes. So if you lay a revert commit on top of a commit then the content is as though the commit was never made. -->
<!-- 2.  Using `git reset -hard`, create a new branch from your branching point, then rename it to `main`, orphaning your current main. -->

<!-- #### Using revert -->

<!-- First I created a copy of the repo, `practice_split_revert/`, so I could show both options. Then I switched to the `main` branch in that copy. -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- cd .. -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- cp -r practice_split practice_split_revert -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- cd practice_split_revert/ -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git branch -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     * first_set_branch -->
<!--       main -->
<!--       second_set_branch -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git checkout main -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     Switched to branch 'main' -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git branch -->
<!--   first_set_branch -->
<!-- * main -->
<!--   second_set_branch -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     * 0841579 (second_set_branch) added to second set -->
<!--     * 0d8e90d first edit in second set -->
<!--     | * 9f2b69a (first_set_branch) added second file to first set -->
<!--     | * ef2a3ee first set edit -->
<!--     |/   -->
<!--     | * b5d4aff (HEAD -> main) added to second set -->
<!--     | * dfa98b0 first edit in second set -->
<!--     | * 43bc368 added second file to first set -->

<!--     |/   -->
<!--     * f945961 add main2 -->
<!--     * 367e25a Adding readme -->

<!-- Then I used a range expression (the `..`) with revert to revert the set of four commits on `main`. Note that the double dot range syntax used like this is left exclusive (i.e. you have to go back one further than the first you want). I also had to provide four commit messages, one for each of the reverting commits. -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git checkout main -->

<!--     Switched to branch 'main' -->

<!--     * 0841579 (second_set_branch) added to second set -->

<!--     |/   -->
<!--     * f945961 add main2 -->
<!--     * 367e25a Adding readme -->

<!-- Now we use `git reset --hard` to force HEAD back to `f945961`. That disconnects the four unwanted commits (I *think* they aren't actually gone from .git folder yet, but they could be deleted any time as they aren't connected to anything.). -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git reset --hard f945961 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!--     HEAD is now at f945961 add main2 -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- * 0841579 (second_set_branch) added to second set -->
<!-- * 0d8e90d first edit in second set -->
<!-- | * 9f2b69a (first_set_branch) added second file to first set -->
<!-- | * ef2a3ee first set edit -->
<!-- |/   -->
<!-- * f945961 (HEAD -> main) add main2 -->
<!-- * 367e25a Adding readme -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- That seems neater, but keep in mind that if you'd pushed `main` to github while those commits were there, anyone else who had built on your repo would have lots of trouble. The `revert` approach goes for messier history, but has the advantage that it doesn't disconnect anyone else. -->

<!-- # Rebase for synchronizing work -->

<!-- When one is working on a problem, others may be working in parallel. And their parallel work may be finished before one's own work is. Thus the starting point for one person's work (branching point) can "go stale" making it harder to integrate. -->

<!-- While `git merge` and resolving syntax level conflicts can resolve some of this, it is often easier to understand and review work if it is presented as changes against an updated starting point. -->

<!-- As a concrete example imagine a project to build a dashboard. Imagine that you fork the repo in January to implement a new type of visualization (let's say a pie chart). You work on this during January and February, finally nailing it down at the start of March. Meanwhile, though, others in the project have spent February introducing a whole new way of accessing databases. By the time you make a pull request at the start of March things have changed a lot since you branched in January. -->

<!-- If you submit a PR without updating, the maintainers will likely ask you to update your branch to make it work with the new database system. -->

<!--     --January-|------February--------------|--March -->

<!--               __pie_chart_branch___________ -->
<!--              /                             \ -->
<!--     main--|--|-----------------------|----|------- -->
<!--                 \                     / -->
<!--                  \__new_database_____/ -->

<!-- First thing to do is to update your local repository with the changes from upstream. -->

<!-- ``` sh -->
<!-- git pull upstream main -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Then you could try two options: -->

<!-- 1.  Either merge `main` into `pie_chart_branch` yourself -->
<!-- 2.  Rebase `pie_chart_branch` on main (as though `pie_chart_branch` was created in late February and you did all the work very quickly!) -->

<!-- Option 1 is possible, but often merging your work involves touching parts of the system you don't know what much about and is better left to the core developers. In addition, merging in this way leaves merge commit messages and some projects really don't like those because they make the history harder to read. -->

<!-- Option 2 is generally preferred, since it focuses on clear communication via PRs that are easier to read and review. -->

<!-- Option 2 is called `rebase` and is explained usefully at [this page from the EdX project](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request). As you rebase, you can also `squash` some of your commits (treat many commits as one) to make them easier to follow for those reviewing your pull request. See the link above for details. -->

<!-- # Removing something from history entirely. -->

<!-- The purpose of `git` is to retain all of your history, so that you can go back to any point in development and recover (as well as experiment while not breaking the mainline of development). Simultaneously when we are working in the open that means that anyone can view any file that was ever in a repository. With that in mind it is not too surprising that if you accidentally add something to git and then push it to github you can have trouble putting "the genie back in the bottle." -->

<!-- Let's say that we create a repo and add a README, then add a SPECIAL_SECRET file with the password "swordfish" in it. Note that I use `git add *` below which is a very common way to accidentally add a problematic file, try to get into the habit of adding files one by one. -->

<!-- So now the file is not there. Or rather it is not in our working directory. The problem is that it is still inside out `.git` folder and we can get it out easily. -->

<!--     git checkout HEAD~1 -->
<!--     Note: checking out 'HEAD~1'. -->

<!--     You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental -->
<!--     changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this -->
<!--     state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout. -->

<!--     If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may -->
<!--     do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example: -->

<!--       git checkout -b <new-branch-name> -->

<!--     HEAD is now at 4d51f91... README edit 2 -->
<!--     lsREADME         SPECIAL_SECRET -->
<!--     cat SPECIAL_SECRET -->
<!--     swordfish -->

<!-- Here I just used `git checkout HEAD~1` which goes one commit back in time, to before we deleted the SPECIAL_SECRET file. Even if we were far ahead, or over on other branches etc, I could always get back by asking to see the code just after the commit that added the file `git checkout 018f6b5` (btw, to get out of `DETACHED HEAD` state just checkout the branch again, we're working on main so it would be `git checkout main`). -->

<!-- So using `git rm` removes a file from the working directories but it doesn't remove it from the git history. And that's a sensible thing, usually you want to be able to go back in time. But sometimes you want to remove something from the history entirely. You can do that using the approaches outlined by Github here: [Removing sensitive data from a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/) -->

<!-- The process is a bit complex (as it should be) but simplified with the `bfg` tool, as described at the link above. First you have to download the tool (which requires Java to run) then follow the instructions step by step. -->

<!-- Keep in mind that if you had pushed this sensitive info to a repo on github and others had then forked or cloned it then that info is not going to be deleted from the clones, so passwords should definitely be changed and you should ask everyone to delete forks/clones and start again. -->

<!-- THere are a set of approachs to avoid uploading sensitive data. A good starting point is discipline around using `.gitignore` which will prevent adding files that should not be added. Another approach is to become familar with using environment variables to hold secrets. This is an evolving area, so ask others how they handle secrets (usually access credentials) when using git. -->

<!-- # Undo almost anything -->

<!-- Undo is sort of the point of version control, but it can be complicated. Here's a useful blog entry: [How to undo almost anything with git](https://github.blog/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/) -->
