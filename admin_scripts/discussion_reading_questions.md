1. How was the study done? What was the population?

2. What list of motivations was found?

3. Which were most surprising to you?

4. Which motivations related most to productivity (and how was productivity defined?)

-----------

1. Two decisions (or types of decisions) that are taken?

- whether to participate (individual decision)
- what you are working on?
- how coding is done micro-level.

- resolving conflicts ("deadlock")
- who should be assigned what work? (giving them an assignment or asking a question of them?)
- what tasks should be automated?
- who owns the code? (what license is used?)
- what shall we call ourselves?
- How do we review submissions?
- what infrastructure/technologies do we use?
- deadlines? release timeline? (does feature X "ship" in next version?)
- will we have and enforce coding standards?

2. Two different structures of governance mentioned.

3. How do motivations relate to the reasoning for governance choices? i.e., projects implement X governance model because participants have y motivations (explain the connection)

Fork syllabus repo.
Clone syllabus repo.

Add folder with username within class_scratch_space, add "project.md" file with possible project idea (just a URL of possible pp project). 

Push, pull request

Then all add upstream and pull upstream.

If time, combine into one document

---------------------

What to demonstrate with continuous integration:

- a long-term way to record intentions
- git can signal syntax conflicts (compile-time)
- CI signals build-time (or run-time) conflicts

How to demonstrate in the paper plane context?

Could have a competition rule that each step can't be more than a tweet.  Say 140 characters.

So, working in pairs, generate a:

- syntax conflict, then resolve (doesn't show in pull request)
- a "run time" conflict in code that is in a pull request, show failing build, then resolve by breaking the step up and pushing new commits (which are auto added to the code).


Discussion order:

Start with quick lecture on types of conflicts.

Agile, Test-driven development

Discovering requirements through prototypes.

Carrying elements forward (that's part of what tests do) (from Giddings paper)

Discusson questions:

1. Conflicts you encountered
2. Why does TravisCI offer their service for free to open source projects?
3. What did Vasiel find?

------------------------

Is it a matter of public concern that only a few percent of a site like Ravelry are men?

- two reasons that it would matter.

1. men tend to have different skills (e.g. technical) and could enhance site for everyone (features of the website, technologies of )
1. no good reasons that it should be a female only activity, inequality replicates itself? can be unwelcoming environment.
1. Awareness of design features: e.g., promotion of engagement might be very narrowly targeted, more men might mean better for a wide variety of female gender expression?


- two reasons that it would not.

1. no claims/expectations of universal knownledge about a topic (but it might become an authority?)
1. this inequity is the result of freedom of choice (aka men are banned), inequity is the result of gender differences resulting in different choices.
1. "just a community of interest"  shared interest, less controversial, fewer "conflicting points of view" to be represented.
1. ravelry is not about preceptions of reality?




How should we (as a society) address inequity in wikipedia coverage?  How is wikipedia addressing it?

How should we (as a society) address inequity in open source software coverage?  Are any organizations addressing this?







Match up with a partner that speaks a language other than English.  Pick a total of four concepts:
- Two concepts that you agree is most likely to be non-culturally specific.
- One concept that you expect to be best covered in each language wikipedia.

For each, read and note differences:

- length
- depth
- citations
- whether it belongs to a wikiproject
- number of users that have edited the page.

Find a machine learning application that uses wikipedia data.  How does it use it? How would language concept diversity be affected?
